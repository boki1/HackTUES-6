# ChaingedVote hardware

## Description

The prototype of Chaingedvote uses ESP32s to create a peer-to-peer network to host the blockchain. For outputing information the system uses OLED i2c displays and for input it simply uses 3 buttons.

## Future ideas

Use different, more efficient hardware(RPi) or chain more less expensive parts together for larger processing power. Verification of the blocks can be faster with more cores.
